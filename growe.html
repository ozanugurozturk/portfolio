									<p style="text-align: left; font-size:16px"><strong> This is the 1 of the 3 group unity projects that I have taken part in during
										 my education. We, as a group of students from all the other game related disciplines in Forsbergs Skola, were asked to deliver 
										 a grid based mobile platform game. We made brainstorming as a group to decide on the concept with considering the requirements 
										 that were stated at the beginning of the project. In the game, players colllects, plant and sell different type of seeds and 
										 grow their online plants and place them in grid based map. In the game, seeds and plants require watering and fertilization to survive and grow
										 as a high quality plant to earn higher game point for players, which are listed and displayed in high-score lists, which requires
										 online save system.
